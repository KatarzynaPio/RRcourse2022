**Basic statistics about the series.**

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Overview <- data.frame("Season" = c(1:9),
                       "Number of Episodes" = c(6,22,25,19,28,26,26,24,25),
                       "Rank" = c(102,67,68,77,52,52,53,87,94),
                       'Average viewership' = c(5.4,8.0,8.3,8.9,9.0,7.8,7.7,6.5,5.1))
kbl(Overview, escape = F) %>%  kable_paper("striped", full_width = F)
```

**Average viewership for each season.**

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align = 'center'}
plot1 <- ggplot(Overview, aes(x = Season, y = Average.viewership))+
  geom_line( color = "#CC8B3C", size = 0.7)+
  geom_point( color = "#CC8B3C", size = 1)+

  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,max(Overview$Season),1))
plot1

**The position of each season in the rankings.**

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4,fig.align = 'center'}
plot1 <- ggplot(Overview, aes(x = Season, y = Rank))+
  geom_line( color = "#CC8B3C", size = 0.7)+
  geom_point( color = "#CC8B3C", size = 1)+
  labs(x = "Season",y = "Average viewership (in millions)") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,max(Overview$Season),1))

**The episode-to-episode changes in viewership.**

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4,fig.align = 'center'}
# data scraped from wikipedia
EpisodeToEpisode <- read.table("IMG/list.txt", sep = " " , header = T ,
                     na.strings ="", stringsAsFactors= F)

#print(EpisodeToEpisode)

EpisodeToEpisode$ViewLast = lag(EpisodeToEpisode$View)
EpisodeToEpisode$ViewChange = 100* round ((EpisodeToEpisode$View- EpisodeToEpisode$ViewLast)/EpisodeToEpisode$ViewLast,4)

#head(EpisodeToEpisode)  

EpisodeToEpisode$Season <- as.factor(EpisodeToEpisode$Season )
plot2 <- ggplot(EpisodeToEpisode, aes(y = ViewChange, x = Episode, fill =  Season ))+
  geom_col()+

#### Observations   
```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide', error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
change = round(((Overview[Overview$Season == max(Overview$Season),]$Average.viewership - Overview[Overview$Season == min(Overview$Season),]$Average.viewership)/Overview[Overview$Season == min(Overview$Season),]$Average.viewership),4)*100
finalSeason =max(Overview$Season)
lastView = Overview[Overview$Season == finalSeason, ]$Average.viewership
mostPopularSeason = Overview[Overview$Average.viewership == max(Overview$Average.viewership),]$Season
mostPopularSeasonAvg = max(Overview$Average.viewership)
mostRankSeason = Overview[Overview$Rank == max(Overview$Rank),]$Season
mostRank =  max(Overview$Rank)
lowestRankSeason = Overview[Overview$Rank == min(Overview$Rank),]$Season
lowestRank =  min(Overview$Rank)
```


The average viewership of **The Office** decreased by `r change` percent between seasons 1 and  `r finalSeason`.  
The viewership of the last season was only `r lastView` million.  
The most popular was season number `r mostPopularSeason` for which the average viewership was equal `r mostPopularSeasonAvg` million.  
On the other hand, the highest rated season was season number `r mostRankSeason`, which ranked #`r mostRank`.  
By comparison, season number`r lowestRankSeason` was the worst, which ranked #`r lowestRank`.
